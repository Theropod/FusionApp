# FusionApp
my fusion app project files

Fusion app can merge mobile webpages with android native components, giving us (especially in China where major Chinese Android Apps and websites are loaded with ads, misleading links and redirects) a much better browsering experience...

This repository is just a brief example of what Fusion App can do, I only used a few simple javascript injections to autofill/autologin and remove ads. Find more in coolapk community.
